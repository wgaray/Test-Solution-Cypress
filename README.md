This is the solution of the Automation with Selenium/Cypress exercise. I use Cypress with Cucumber in this case. I create two test cases to complete the workflow, because Cypress has some limitations (the tool doesn't allow to navigate in pages with different domains, and then go back). This is an [article](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs#Same-origin) where explains some of these limitations.
Also, I do the same exercise with Java and Selenium in another branch.

**I don't complete the Jest exercise, beacuse i never code Unit Tests.**
